# A British culture-based Collection Game implemented by React + AWS serverless technology
I created this to encourage Chinese students who study in the UK to actively go out to explore this new world

## Check out the achievement list
* it's organized by UK locations like London, Manchester, Liverpool, Bristol, etc.
* Under each category, there are a list of achievements with various rarity and conditions.
* This part integrated the content management system (ContentFul), which means anyone can add contents of achievements without any technical knowledge!

## Complete the achievement by pressing the button only when you meet the conditions!
* I clicked the button to confirm that I've completed my MSc project presentation at Manchester Metropolitan University. It's a special moment, reminding me of the old times that inspired me to create this project.
* Afterward, I earned bonus points in my personal file based on the rarity of the completed achievements. These achievements will also be collected as cards in my personal album, with detailed data about each completion recorded.
